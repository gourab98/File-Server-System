# File-Server-System
In this Project, we are trying to develop a File  Server System in Java to allow users/clients to download a file from the server or upload a file into the server using sockets.

## Base Features:
* When the server system is loaded, it will initiate the required communication setup so that clients can join in the system.
* When the client system is loaded, an option to provide the IP address/port number of the server.
* A proper GUI with a directory service that can show the available directories and files.
* A proper context-menu (a right-click mouse operation) for uploading a file in the server.
* A proper context-menu (a right-click mouse operation) for downloading a file from the server.
